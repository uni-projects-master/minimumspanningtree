# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. The MST problem involves finding a subset of edges in a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

## Contents

- Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm, which adds edges in increasing order of weight, ensuring no cycles are formed.
- Implementation of Prim's algorithm, which grows the MST by adding the minimum weight edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it.
